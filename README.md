Prerana Kailash Pattnaik

AI Engineer | Specializing in Agentic AI | Vertex AI • Gemini • Google ADK

Welcome to my portfolio!
I’m Prerana Kailash Pattnaik, an aspiring AI Engineer specializing in Agentic AI — passionate about building intelligent, multimodal agents that think, speak, and act with purpose.

My focus lies in designing and deploying interactive AI systems powered by Google’s cutting-edge ecosystem — including Vertex AI, Gemini, and Google ADK (Agent Development Kit). I’m driven by the belief that the future of software will be agentic and assistive — where AI not only understands but also collaborates.

I love experimenting with Vertex AI models, Gemini Pro, and Agent Builder, integrating them seamlessly with Firebase AI Studio to create web-based, interactive, and human-centered AI experiences. My approach blends cloud, creativity, and code, transforming abstract ideas into AI systems that understand, respond, and act intelligently.

I hold certifications in:

Fundamentals of Building AI Agents – IBM (Coursera)
Python for Data Science, AI & Development - IBM
Data Structures & Algorithms in Python: Fundamental Data Structures – Infosys Springboard 
Introduction to Software Engineering – IBM
Artificial Intelligence Foundation Certification – Infosys Springboard
Solving Problems with Creative and Critical Thinking – IBM


Through my projects — like SproutGrowAgent (shortlisted for Google Cloud Agentic AI Day 2025), WanderWise AI, and PalAI — I’ve gained hands-on experience in creating AI-driven, cloud-native applications that combine voice, vision, and context to solve real-world problems.

My passion also extends to open-source collaboration and community learning. As a contributor at GSSoC ’25 (GirlScript Summer of Code) and founder of SheCodesHerWay, I actively support women in tech and mentor developers exploring AI.

My vision is clear:

“To become an AI Engineer shaping the next generation of agentic, intelligent, and responsible AI systems — powered by Google Cloud and built for human impact.”
