Aspiring AI Product Manager | Building Agentic & GenAI Products | Google ADK Expert | Product Experience

I’m an AI Product Designer working at the intersection of Agentic AI, Generative AI, and human-centered product design, with hands-on experience across the Google Cloud Agentic AI stack — Google ADK, Gemini, Vertex AI, and Genkit.

I design AI products where user intent leads and technology follows.

🧠 AI Product Design Philosophy

My work starts with problem discovery, not tools.

I focus on:

Understanding who the user is

What decision or task they’re trying to complete

Where AI can meaningfully assist, not over-automate

Early in the design process, I define:

The AI’s role, scope, and boundaries

Failure behavior & fallback paths

Human-in-the-loop checkpoints

Confidence signals and explainability

My goal is to make complex agentic systems feel intuitive, trustworthy, and usable, even for non-technical users.

💡 AI Product Development & Prototyping

I follow a Vibe Coding workflow to turn ideas into working AI products using:

Google AI Studio & Firebase AI Studio

Google Antigravity

AI-assisted tools like Gemini, ChatGPT, and GitHub Copilot

This enables rapid:

End-to-end AI product prototyping

MVP validation of AI-driven user experiences

Iteration from concept → demo-ready product
