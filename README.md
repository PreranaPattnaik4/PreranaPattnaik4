Welcome to my portfolio! I'm **Prerana Pattnaik**, an aspiring AI/ML Engineer with a passion for building impactful tools, learning in public, and giving back through open-source projects.

💡 About Me  
I'm the founder of **Simplified Computer Science**, an open platform where I blend creativity, code, and education. With an MCA and a growing passion for AI/NLP, I focus on building inclusive tech tools, contributing to communities, and sharing my journey as a developer, mentor, and learner.

🌍 Open Source & Future Aspirations  

📌 I'm currently a **Contributor @ SSoC4'25 (Script Summer of Code)** – proudly learning, building, and collaborating on open-source AI tools.

🌟 I sincerely wish to be selected for **GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC)** – a platform that deeply resonates with my mission to grow as a contributor and build beginner-friendly AI/NLP projects with real-world impact.

✨ One of my biggest dreams is to become a part of **Google Summer of Code (GSoC)** and work with global mentors to improve open-source NLP tools and uplift developer communities worldwide.
