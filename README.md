Welcome to my portfolio! I'm Prerana Pattnaik, an aspiring AI/ML Engineer with a passion for building impactful tools, learning in public, and giving back through open-source projects.

💡 About Me  
I focus on building inclusive tech tools, contributing to open-source projects, and continuously growing as a Machine Learning contributor. With an MCA and hands-on experience in AI/NLP development, I'm committed to collaborative learning and real-world impact.

🌍 Open Source & Future Aspirations  

📌 I'm currently a Contributor @ SSoC4'25 (Script Summer of Code) – proudly learning, building, and collaborating on open-source AI tools.

🌟 I sincerely wish to be selected for GirlScript Summer of Code (GSSoC) – a platform that beautifully aligns with my mission to grow as a contributor and build beginner-friendly AI/NLP projects with real-world impact.

🛠️ Why GSSoC?
- I wish to grow as a contributor in the open-source community.  
- I want to collaborate on beginner-friendly projects that promote learning and innovation.  
- I wish to give back by contributing to impactful solutions and uplifting fellow developers.  

🌈 I'm preparing and contributing continuously with the hope that I'll earn the opportunity to grow through the GSSoC journey.

✨ One of my biggest dreams is to participate in the Google Summer of Code (GSoC) and collaborate with global mentors. My goal is to contribute to impactful AI/NLP tools, improve real-world open-source projects, and become part of the global open-source ecosystem.
